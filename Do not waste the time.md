## **Do Not Waste the Time**

*For my loved ones*

*These thoughts are not just reflections — they are **my wish for you**.*
*That you do not waste your life on illusions, on lies, or regrets.*
*That you live fully, consciously, and with love — right now.*

### 🌌 **A Reminder of Our Place in the Universe**

**Man is not eternal — do not waste time.**

Humanity must go through countless generations in an attempt to achieve Harmony, only to ultimately disappear without a trace.

In the context of the Universe, the entire history of mankind is less than the period of oscillation of the most active atom.

Knowledge does not come suddenly — it is the reward earned by the lives of **all who came before**.

### 🌍 **Who Are We?**

We, humans, are representatives of the animal world of planet Earth. 
We appeared and live here, on this planet.
We are part of nature — just like the largest whale in the ocean or the smallest bacterium.

Our Earth is a planet. Is one of many planets orbiting our star, the Sun. 
The Sun and its planets form the solar system, drifting within a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
At the heart of our galaxy lies a black hole.
The Milky Way, like countless other galaxies, drifts through the vast Universe — a space so immense that humans have only glimpsed its smallest parts.

Why is everything spherical?
Because **the sphere is the most balanced form in space.**

> **Do not waste your time on those who lie to you about this.**

### 🧠 **On Consciousness and Time**

Human beings possess a rare and invaluable gift — **consciousness**:
awareness of self, of others, of the world.

We can analyze, imagine, plan, and remember.
We perceive **past**, **present**, and **future** — yet only **present** is real.

The **Past** is a foundation — like a rock behind us.
We can push off from it, but we cannot return. There is no longer any past.
To live in the past is to **deny the future**.

The **Future** is just a **hope** for the next moment..
But no force in nature guarantees the next moment.
Nobody's promised tomorrow.

We exist only in the **moment of present**.

> **Don’t waste your time on what cannot be returned.
> Appreciate what you have — right now.**
