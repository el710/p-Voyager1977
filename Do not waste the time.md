## **Do Not Waste the Time**

*For my loved ones*

*These thoughts are not just reflections — they are **my wish for you**.*
*That you do not waste your life on illusions, on lies, or regrets.*
*That you live fully, consciously, and with love — right now.*

### 🌌 **A Reminder of Our Place in the Universe**

**Man is not eternal — do not waste time.**

Humanity must go through countless generations in an attempt to achieve Harmony, only to ultimately disappear without a trace.

In the context of the Universe, the entire history of mankind is less than the period of oscillation of the most active atom.

Knowledge does not come suddenly — it is the reward earned by the lives of **all who came before**.

### 🌍 **Who Are We?**

We, humans, are representatives of the animal world of planet Earth. 
We appeared and live here, on this planet.
We are part of nature — just like the largest whale in the ocean or the smallest bacterium.

Our Earth is a planet. Is one of many planets orbiting our star, the Sun. 
The Sun and its planets form the solar system, drifting within a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
At the heart of our galaxy lies a black hole.
The Milky Way, like countless other galaxies, drifts through the vast Universe — a space so immense that humans have only glimpsed its smallest parts.

Why is everything spherical?
Because **the sphere is the most balanced form in space.**

> **Do not waste your time on those who lie to you about this.**

### 🧠 **On Consciousness and Time**

Human beings possess a rare and invaluable gift — **consciousness**:
awareness of self, of others, of the world.

We can analyze, imagine, plan, and remember.
We perceive **past**, **present**, and **future** — yet only **present** is real.

The **Past** is a foundation — like a rock behind us.
We can push off from it, but we cannot return. There is no longer any past.
To live in the past is to **deny the future**.

The **Future** is just a **hope** for the next moment..
But no force in nature guarantees the next moment.
Nobody's promised tomorrow.

We exist only in the **moment of present**.

> **Don’t waste your time on what cannot be returned.
> Appreciate what you have — right now.**

### ⏳ Time

Time is the most precious gift of life.
Life gives you time to feel and understand this world — and then, you vanish forever.

A moment means nothing unless it is filled with Feeling.
Feelings are the colors with which we paint the moments of our lives.
A human can shape and control their own emotional palette.
This is our most awe-inspiring ability —
and at the same time, the heaviest burden of a being born on Earth.

A human life has no Meaning, no Grand Purpose.
It has a beginning, a chain of conscious, heartfelt moments — and an end.
To truly feel and understand life, you must always remember:
**this moment could be your last**.

> **Do not waste time.**

### 🧬 Human Nature

One human is not the same as another.
The species Homo Sapiens may be one, but within it are many kinds.

No matter how long humanity circles through the spiral of history —
the "rakes" will always be there.

No matter how high civilization rises, there will always be:
Beastlike and truly Human,
Immoral and deeply moral,
Murderers and Parents,
Abusers and Protectors,
The Free and the Tyrants…

**This is our nature.**

> **Do not waste your time trying to reform others.**

### ⚔️ Good and Evil

Good and Evil are two halves of the human being.
Good is the bright wealth of consciousness — accumulated by humanity through its history.
Evil is the dark, beastlike inheritance of our past.

As you create Good, remember: Evil cannot be erased.
It never disappears.
Half a body cannot survive.
And if Evil is not seen — it means only one thing:
it hides in shadow, preparing.

Evil does not understand Good, just as fish do not understand the sky.
It always seeks to displace Good —
simply because, to Evil, Good is an empty, unclaimed space.

So, Good must not be naive.
It must not hope that Evil will transform.
Good must guard the border, always carrying its shield and sword.

Evil is not an opinion.
It is not "another set of rights."
It is not a lack of capacity.
You cannot negotiate with it.

To defeat Evil that steps out of the shadows, one must be ready to risk and to sacrifice —
often in the most literal sense.

    Now switch Good and Evil… and read again.

> **Do not waste your time on war.**

### 🕊️ Freedom

Freedom is the highest achievement of human consciousness.
It is the level of awareness from which a person can truly see and understand the world as it is.

The path to freedom is hard and solitary.
It begins with the need to rely only on oneself,
and continues through the long struggle
to overcome the weight of history and social conditioning.

A free person lives beyond labels and traditions.
They understand that they owe nothing to anyone — and no one owes them anything.
They cherish the right of every human being to be free.

And only **Love** for one another can unite truly free people.

> **Do not waste your time pursuing the goals of others.**

### 👥 The Value of One Human

**The most precious thing to a human is another human.**
In the vast, boundless Universe, nothing can take their place.

Imagine: the entire Earth, all of it — and not a single soul left but you.
Imagine that from this very moment, you are alone.
Forever alone on the whole planet.

Would your daily tasks still matter?
Would your plans for tomorrow hold any meaning?
Would your possessions and money be worth anything?

What value would remain in ideas like country, nation, borders?

What would you be willing to give up just to see, to hear, to speak with one living person again?

To live means to **feel other people** —
those who are near,
those who are far,
those who were once with you and now only live in memory.

They are my Life.
They are every fleeting moment.
They are each note of sorrow and joy,
of delight and longing,
of hatred and love.

I believe that if someone were to become the last human on Earth,
then at the very moment they truly grasp their solitude —
their consciousness would die. And their heart would stop.

> **Do not waste your time on things.
    Nothing lasts forever — all things fade away.**
